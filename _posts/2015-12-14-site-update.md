Hello! Welcome to my updated site, and from using [Ghost](https://ghost.org){:target= "_blank" }, I'm now simply using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com){:target= "_blank" } instead. The site's front-end is barebones for now and I'll be updating it every now and then, although, I'll be focusing more on publishing content.

This site is now hosted through GitHub Pages for free. If you want to host your own website for free, try [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com){:target= "_blank" }. Of course, you'll have to learn git and GitHub first. Additionally, you need to know at least markdown syntax for writing posts. If you're a software developer like me, this should be fundamental for you, and all you need to have is a [GitHub](https://github.com){:target= "_blank" } account (which you should already have if you're a serious software developer).

Have some questions or comments? Please don't hesitate to contact me: [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }})
