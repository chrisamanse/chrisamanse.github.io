Hi, my name is Chris Amanse, and I am a software engineer, currently focusing on Swift and iOS development. I recently finished my Computer Engineering degree in Ateneo de Manila University last June 2016. I am currently working at [Symantec](https://www.symantec.com/) as a Software Engineer.

I'm passionate in learning and solving problems. I'm interested in automation, and cryptography. With my passion for coding, Swift, and cryptography, I've created a crypto library built in pure Swift called [CryptoKit](https://github.com/chrisamanse/CryptoKit), which is open source and available in GitHub. I'm an open source advocate, and I believe that open source is a huge contribution to the advancement of software and technology. Thus, I often read and contribute to open source projects, and publish most of my libraries in my [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisamanse).

Feel free to contact me through my [email](mailto:christopheramanse@gmail.com), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChrisAmanse).
