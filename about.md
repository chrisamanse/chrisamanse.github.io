  Hi, I'm Chris, and I'm a software engineer. Currently, I am finishing my degree in Computer Engineering in [Ateneo de Manila University](http://www.ateneo.edu){:target= "_blank" } in the Philippines. I like to code, and I prefer programming apps for **iOS**.
  
  I am passionate in building software that helps people increase their productivity. I'm focused in building mobile apps for iOS using **Swift** with Xcode. I've been working with iOS development since 2012, when I first learned **Objective-C**, Apple's only programming language at that time. You can find some of my apps in the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/joe-christopher-paul-amanse/id991662000){:target= "_blank" }.
  
  Besides mobile development, I am also familiar with web programming and markup languages. In my spare time, I have built websites for clients, using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a theme they envisioned, and integrated it with a simple, user-friendly CMS using PHP.
  
  I'm also an open source enthusiast, as I believe that open source projects helps advance our technology faster. I have open sourced my apps, libraries and other projects in [Github](https://github.com/chrisamanse){:target="_blank"}.
  
  As a software engineer, I fell in love with project management while using some of the best collaboration tools and techniques such as git, Slack, and Agile software development methods, which made our team's development faster and more efficient. By using these tools, I learned setting up servers, automating tasks and finding the most efficient way of completing tasks.
  
  Besides making software, I also like building robots using RCX and NXT Legos, and Arduino.
