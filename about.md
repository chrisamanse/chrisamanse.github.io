Hi, my name is Chris Amanse, and I am an iOS developer. Currently, I am finishing my degree in Computer Engineering in Ateneo de Manila University.

During my free time, I like to build iOS apps and libraries. I also love open source, so I like to read source codes of projects in GitHub, and to contribute to them as well. I believe open source really helps out software and technology move forward faster. You can look at some of my projects in [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisamanse). If you want to collaborate on a project, you can contact me through my [email](mailto:christopheramanse@gmail.com). You can also connect with me through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChrisAmanse).

You can also find some of my apps in the [App Store](http://appstore.com/joechristopherpaulamanse?at=1001l9X4).
