Hi, my name is Chris Amanse, and I am a software engineer, currently focusing on Swift and iOS development. I am currently working at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) as an iOS Engineer.

I'm passionate in learning and solving problems. I'm interested in automation, and cryptography. With my passion for coding, Swift, and cryptography, I've created a crypto library built in pure Swift called [CryptoKit](https://github.com/chrisamanse/CryptoKit), which is open source and available in GitHub. I'm an open source advocate, and I believe that open source is a huge contribution to the advancement of software and technology. I often read and contribute to open source projects, and publish most of my libraries in [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisamanse).

Feel free to contact me through my email: chrisamanse &lt;at&gt; icloud &#60;dot&#62; com.
